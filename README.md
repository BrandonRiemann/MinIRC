## What is it?
MinIRC is a basic prototype (i.e., work in progress) of a minimalistic IRC client using the ncurses library designed for POSIX-compatible operating systems. The goal of the project was to design a simple interface and gain familiarity with the RFC 1459 protocol (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) which IRC uses. Many websites that offer chat features often have an IRC server allowing the user to connect to the chat from a program such as this. This offers flexibility in how the chat client is implemented, such as UI design, keyboard controls, and other additional functionality that the developer might wish to add.
